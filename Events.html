                    Second Phase- Competition
                    This competition consists of three rounds
                    a) 1st Round (Idea submission): In this round, participants will have to choose a project which
                    falls into the domain of A.I. and Robotics and submit tentative information about the project they
                    will be working on.
                    b) 2nd Round (Video and Report Submission): In this round, participants will have to submit a
                    report and a short video in which they will put all the project work they have done Ex. CAD
                    design/Circuit diagram/Code etc.
                    c) 3rd Round (Presentation): This round will be the final round of the competition in which the
                    selected participants will have to present their projects through PowerPoint presentations that
